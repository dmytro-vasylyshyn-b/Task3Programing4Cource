Here is the generated text, based on the data and examples from your lecture (including Example 1 and Example 2).
Here there are numerical sequences, matrices (of directions and Hessian) and mixed data that can be used as a test set or an example of report formatting.

1. Matrices of directions and rank checking
This is an example of a matrix composed of direction vectors for checking their linear independence, as described in the algorithm.

Matrix P (from Example 1):
-3 & 0
0 & 1
Rank of this matrix: rank(P) = 2 = n, therefore the system is independent

2. Hessian matrix (for the function from Example 2):
For the function f(x)=3x_{1}^{2}+2x_{1}x_{2}+x_{2}^{2} the matrix of second derivatives looks like this:
6 & 2
2 & 2

2. Numerical data in rows (Iteration log)
Below is the sequence of points x and steps lambda (alpha) from Example 2,
written as data rows.

Format: Iteration | Alpha_step | X1_coord | X2_coord

Plaintext
0   0.00    6.00    4.00   (Initial point x0)
1  -10.00   6.00   -6.00   (After movement along S2)
2  -4.00    2.00   -6.00   (After movement along S1)
3   4.00    2.00   -2.00   (After movement along S2)
4   0.50    0.00    0.00   (Final point x4, minimum)

3. Mixed text (Algorithm parameters)
Text containing variable notations, vectors and stopping conditions taken from the algorithm description and examples.

Input parameters:
Initial point: $x^{(0)} = (8; 9)^T$
Accuracy: $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$
Initial basis: $p^1 = (1, 0, 0...)$, $p^n = (0, ... 0, 1)$

Vector computations (Example 1):
Computation of the conjugate direction $\overline{p}$ via the difference of points:
Vector A: $y^3 = (5; 6)$
Vector B: $y^1 = (8; 6)$
Result $p_{new} = y^3 - y^1 = (-3; 0)$

Checking the stopping condition:
Norm calculation: $||x^1 - x^0|| = \sqrt{(8-5)^2 + (9-6)^2} = 4.24$
Condition: $4.24 > \epsilon$ (continue the search).

4. Raw Data Block (for copying)
If you need just a block of numbers to insert into the code (a 4x2 matrix of passage point coordinates from Example 2):

Plaintext 
 6.0   4.0
 6.0  -6.0
 2.0  -6.0
 2.0  -2.0
 0.0   0.0
-4.0   4.0
(The last row is the conjugate direction vector $(-4, 4)$)
